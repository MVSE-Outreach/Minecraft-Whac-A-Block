Minecraft is a popular sandbox open world-building game. A free version of Minecraft is available for the Raspberry Pi; it also comes with a programming interface. This means you can write commands and scripts in Python code to build things in the game automatically. It's a great way to learn Python! 

If you have already completed "Getting Started With Programming The Minecraft World" and want to do more, how about creating your own game in Minecraft, a "game in a game"?

The game you are going to create is called "Whac-a-Block", inspired by the original arcade game "Whac-a-Mole". The objective of the game is to whack (or hit with a sword) the blocks that light up as glowstone, and turn them back to stone.
